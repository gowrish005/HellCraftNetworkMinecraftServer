  # Should placeholders from PlaceholderAPI be replaced in commands?
  # Recommended Version: 2.11.3
  placeholderapi: true

rewards:
  # 'exampleOne' is the ID for this reward.
  # You can use letters (A-Z and a-z) and numbers (0-9) for the id, but not symbols.
  # Every ID should be different, but you can have as many as you want.
  exampleOne:
    # If the player does not have this permission, the reward will not be triggered.
    # Defaults to empty (not required)
    permission: ""

    # Chance is calculated using RNG (Java ThreadLocalRandom)
    # The value checked is a percent that comes from the value of (chance / max-chance)
    # This example will give a (5/1000) or a 0.5% chance of this reward occurring.
    chance: 5
    max-chance: 1000

    # If you set this to true, the mobs in the mob-list will activate rewards
    # If you set this to false, all mobs will activate rewards except the ones in the list
    mob-whitelist: true

    # PLAYER is technically a mob
    mob-list:
      - PLAYER
      - CREEPER

    # If you set this to true, only the worlds in the list will activate this reward
    # If you set this to false, All worlds will activate this reward except the ones in the list
    world-whitelist: true

    # A list of worlds
    # World names are case sensitive, "wOrLd" is not the same as "world"
    world-list:
      - "world"
      - "world_nether"
      - "world_the_end"

    # Set this to true if a single command should be chosen randomly instead of running all commands
    random-command: false

    # A list of commands to execute when the reward chance is successful
    # Valid Placeholders:
    # - {player} - the player who killed the entity that triggered this reward
    # - {enemy} - The name of the entity that was killed. (e.g. SirBlobman)
    # - {enemy_type} - The type of the entity that was killed. (e.g. PLAYER)
    commands:
      - "give {player} diamond 1"
      - "msg {player} You won a diamond for killing {enemy}"
      - "msg {player} Kill more {enemy_type} for a 0.5% chance of a diamond."

  exampleTwo:
    # Some rewards can have requirements.
    requirements:
      # This example requirement ensures that the enemy killed has $500 in their Vault economy account
      # Requirements may exclude mobs if they require a player, even if mobs are included in the list
      # The only available requirements types at this time are 'economy' and 'experience'.
      # Economy requires a decimal 'amount'. Experience requires an integer 'amount'.
      economyExampleOne:
        type: economy
        check-enemy: true
        amount: 500.0
    mob-whitelist: false
    world-whitelist: false
    chance: 1
    max-chance: 2
    random-command: false
    commands:
      - "eco take {enemy} 500"
      - "eco give {player} 500"
