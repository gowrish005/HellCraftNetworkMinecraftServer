# Hello Server Owner! Welcome to the superFreeze Configuration!
# Here you can configure stuff on how the plugin works! Like if you
# wan't the Title and Subtitle to show or not or only show the title
# So, lets get started!

# Here you will tell the plugin if you would like 1.8 titles to be desplayed while the target player is frozen...
frozen-title-enabled: true
frozen-subtitle-enabled: true

# Here you will define what mode you want the Frozen Subtitle to use if enabled
# Here is a index of all the modes:
#
#   1 - Just Plain Ol Pre-Defined Text (If text uses no color codes it will animate!)
#   2 - Random (Will Show Text Like "Get R3kt Scrub", or "Y U DO DIS?") 
frozen-subtitle-mode: 2
forzen-subtitle-text: "You Have Been Frozen!"  #Only For 1

# Here you will set the chat message that the player will get, for example your
# discord or your teamspeak link and maybe your website.
chat-message: "&6&lTeamspeak Currently Unadvaible!"

# Its basic, automaticly ban the player...
auto-ban: true
auto-ban-message: "&6&l&oYou left the game while frozen!"

# Dont Edit the config, this is what helps update the plugins config.yml 
# (You will still need to remove config for full details and comments)
